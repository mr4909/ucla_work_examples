    "text": "Background\nThe UCLA Law Behind Bars Data Project began in March 2020 to track the impact of COVID-19 on incarcerated people and corrections staff. As the pandemic exposed deep vulnerabilities in carceral systems, the project became a vital resource for:\n\nAdvocates and legal teams fighting for urgent reforms\n\nJournalists and researchers investigating conditions behind bars\n\nPolicymakers aiming to understand the scope of the crisis\n\nIn February 2023, the project expanded beyond COVID and relaunched with a focus on all-cause mortality in U.S. prisons and jails. The result is the most comprehensive public dataset of deaths in custody nationwide—filling a critical gap left by the federal government’s cessation of mortality reporting in 2019.\nThis dataset has already shaped national discourse. A front-page New York Times investigation, using Behind Bars data, found a 61% increase in prison mortality from 2019 to 2020. West Virginia stood out with the highest known mortality rate—96 deaths per 10,000 people incarcerated."

Specifically:\n\nI downloaded the deaths in custody dataset from the project’s GitHub repository\n\nI focused on West Virginia, a state where I’ve led cross-system justice data work\n\nI incorporated contextual insights on carceral conditions, health care access, and system capacity in WV\n\nMy goal is to highlight how this dataset can support deeper, local investigations into carceral mortality—especially in states like West Virginia, where deaths in custody are consistently high but poorly understood."
